            <p>Welcome. You've made it to my Website! Right Now it looks bad. I'm aware, but this website is in it's infancy and I will Develop it as I Mature my Skills. So for now its just this bad, horrible purple mess.
                The Website will be host to a bunch of my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> (Seen in the Projects Page), Blogs (For Now, Very Raw Blogs, Might Link my Twitter later using embeds), and other miscellaneous topics.
                For Now, Just take a look around
