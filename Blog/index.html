                    <h2>The Dead Internet</h2>
                    <p class="date-stamp">Posted: January 12, 2026</p>
                    <p>
                        The Internet is dead. Everywhere I go, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instgragram, and Tiktok, Theres always a AI pretenting ti be human.
                        And the the fact the people think its fine, or the fact they are willing to use ai for their own perosnal gain. Get money for basically doing nothing. 
                        <br><br>
                        But this is only a systmom of a bigger trend. Its the growing lack of trust that is continuing to grow. AI fundamentally is a tool that dpes not not create, it only mimics.
                        And as more and more people use it, the less and less original content is created. Leading to a endless cycle of AI generated content mimicing other AI generated content.
                        Take the AI Ghibili trend. It showed how shallow and uncreative people were willing to be. "Hey Grok, Make me a picture, hey ChatGPT, Make me a painting, Hey Gemini, Make me a medieval drawing"
                        It really shows how people don't care about art, which only gains its value the more human effort it is, as art is a reflection of the human experience.
                        <br><br>
                        Honestly, I don't know where this rant is going. Am i making a point? No. Its just me venting about how the internet changed since 2020

                    <h2>New Site, New Me</h2>
                    <p class="date-stamp">Posted: January 9, 2026</p>
                    <p>
                       Again, I updated the Site. The old one, Simply sucks ass, and considering i accientally paid for the domain again, might as well do something about it. 
                       This time going full balls to the walls on the theming. Neocities Y2K theme. Fake ads, and more. Added a Music Section. Might actually work on this more.
                       I really like the look of it. Obviously its just HTML and CSS for now, no Javascript, but i wanna add more things to it, including a way to update the pages within the website and without manually editing the HTML
                       But, for now, I am proud.

                        Begone Ugly Purple! Hello White Black and Blue. Reorganized files to be better to organize and future proof. Rewrote Home Page to be a bit better, still empty though :(
                        Honestly though, so far these blogs have just been Website update notes :/
